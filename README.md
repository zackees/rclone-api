Got a lot of data to transfer quickly? This package is for you.

This library was built out of necessity to transfer large amounts of AI training data. Aggressive defaults means this api will transfer faster than rclone does in stock settings.

You can have [rclone](https://rclone.org/) in your path or else the api will download it.

# Install

`pip install rclone-api`

pypi link: https://pypi.org/project/rclone-api/

# Quick

In addition to providing easy python use for rclone, this package provides additional features:

  * Aggressive default settings for copying / syncing operations for extreme performance.
  * Database Support: Dump repo information to an sqlite/postgres/mysql database.
    * One repo path -> table.
  * Scoped objects for:
    * Mounts.
    * File servers.
    * Enforces correct cleanup
  * Mounts are easier - platform specific setup and teardown.
  * Resumable multi-part uploads when s3 is the destination.
  * Fast diffing src/dst repos as a stream of `list[str]`.
    * Find which files need are missing and need to be copied.
    * Efficiently build pipelines to select copy strategy based on file size.
  * Walk a directory.
    * Breath first.
    * Depth first.
  * Use the HttpServer to slice out byte ranges from extremely large files.


## Example

```python

from rclone_api import Rclone, DirListing, Config

RCLONE_CONFIG = Config("""
[dst]
type = s3
account = *********
key = ************
""")


def test_ls_glob_png(self) -> None:
    rclone = Rclone(RCLONE_CONFIG)
    path = f"dst:{BUCKET_NAME}/my_data"
    listing: DirListing = rclone.ls(path, glob="*.png")
    self.assertGreater(len(listing.files), 0)
    for file in listing.files:
        self.assertIsInstance(file, File)
        # test that it ends with .png
        self.assertTrue(file.name.endswith(".png"))
    # there should be no directories with this glob
    self.assertEqual(len(listing.dirs), 0)
```
